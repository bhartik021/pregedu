            <h4 class="h4-style">Eat a healthy, balanced diet:</h4>
            <p class="p-style">
              Eating a healthy, balanced diet is crucial during pregnancy. A
              well-balanced diet will ensure that you and your growing baby
              receive all the nutrients required for healthy growth and
              development. Include a variety of fruits and vegetables for
              essential vitamins and minerals, whole grains over refined grains
              to maintain healthy blood sugar levels, lean protein sources such
              as fish, poultry, and beans in your diet. Limit your caffeine
              intake to 200 mg per day and stay hydrated with water and foods
              high in water content.

            <p class="p-style">
              Taking prenatal vitamins is essential during pregnancy. A prenatal
              vitamin containing folic acid and iron can support healthy fetal
              development. Talk to your healthcare provider about the
              appropriate dosage and timing.

            <h4 class="h4-style">Practice good hygiene:</h4>
            <p class="p-style">
              Good hygiene is important for everyone, but especially during
              pregnancy. Wash your hands frequently to reduce the risk of
              illness and infection, and brush and floss regularly to maintain
              good oral health. Practice safe food handling to avoid foodborne
              illnesses.

            <h4 class="h4-style">Educate yourself about labor and delivery:</h4>
            <p class="p-style">
              Educating yourself about labor and delivery can help you feel more
              prepared and in control during the process. Take childbirth
              classes to learn about the labor and delivery process, and
              consider writing a birth plan to communicate your preferences with
              your healthcare provider.

            <h4 class="h4-style">Attend prenatal appointments:</h4>
            <p class="p-style">
              Regular prenatal check-ups are important to monitor your health
              and the health of your baby. Attend all scheduled prenatal
              appointments, and discuss any questions or concerns with your
              healthcare provider. Prenatal appointments can also provide an
              opportunity to track your baby's growth and development and to
              identify any potential health issues early on.

            <p class="p-style">
              Harmful substances can be especially damaging during pregnancy. Do
              not smoke or use any tobacco products, and avoid alcohol
              consumption. Exposure to chemicals and toxins should also be
              avoided as much as possible.

            <h4 class="h4-style">Get enough rest:</h4>
            <p class="p-style">
              Getting enough rest during pregnancy is essential for your health
              and your baby's growth and development. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep
              per night, and take naps as needed throughout the day. If you have
              trouble sleeping, try relaxation techniques such as deep breathing
              or meditation, or speak with your healthcare provider about sleep
              aids that are safe to use during pregnancy.

            <h4 class="h4-style">Stay active:</h4>
            <p class="p-style">
              Staying active during pregnancy is important for both you and your
              baby. Engage in regular exercise such as walking, swimming, or
              prenatal yoga. Talk to your healthcare provider about appropriate
              exercise options and limitations. Regular exercise can help you
              maintain a healthy weight, improve your mood, and reduce your risk
              of gestational diabetes.

            <h4 class="h4-style">Manage stress:</h4>
            <p class="p-style">
              Pregnancy can be a stressful time, but it is important to manage
              stress for your own health and the health of your baby. Practice
              relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation.
              Consider prenatal yoga or massage to reduce stress. If you feel
              overwhelmed or anxious, talk to your healthcare provider.

            <h4 class="h4-style">Prepare for postpartum:</h4>
            <p class="p-style">
              Preparing for postpartum is important for your physical and
              emotional health after delivery. Consider a support system for
              after delivery, such as a doula or family member. Educate yourself
              about postpartum depression and seek help if needed. Plan for
              breastfeeding by talking to a lactation consultant and setting up
              a nursing area in your home.
