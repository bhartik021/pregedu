              Congratulations, you are now six months pregnant! At this stage,
              you are in the second trimester of pregnancy, and your baby is
              growing and developing rapidly. This is a crucial period for both
              you and your growing baby, so it's important to take care of

              The sixth month of pregnancy is usually the period between week 21
              and week 24. At this stage, your baby is about 10 inches long and
              weighs around 1 pound. During this time, your baby's organs,
              including the lungs, heart, and brain, continue to develop, and
              your baby starts to put on weight rapidly.
