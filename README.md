## Problem Statement
Pregnant women face a variety of challenges that can affect their health and the health of their developing baby. These challenges can range from physical discomforts such as morning sickness and fatigue to more serious health issues such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. In addition, pregnant women may also face emotional and psychological challenges such as anxiety, depression, and stress.
