## Problem Statement

A guidance app for pregnant lady to significantly reduce the infant mortility rate.

## Our Solution

The lack of accessible, comprehensive, and sustainable pregnancy education for expecting mothers. Many women may not have access to reliable resources or may not know what steps to take to have a healthy and sustainable pregnancy. PregEdu aims to bridge this gap by providing a platform where women can access expert resources, connect with other expecting mothers, and receive support throughout their pregnancy journey. PregEdu aims to empower women with the knowledge and resources they need to have a healthy and sustainable pregnancy, which ultimately leads to better health outcomes for both mother and child.

PregEdu provides a range of features to help expecting mothers throughout their pregnancy journey, including:

* ***Pregnancy Month Blogs:*** Providing comprehensive and informative blogs about each month of pregnancy can help promote SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being - by providing pregnant women with the knowledge they need to have a healthy pregnancy and childbirth experience. This can also promote gender equality by empowering women with the resources they need to make informed decisions about their health and the health of their baby.

* ***Health Check:*** A feature that allows users to check their health status and receive recommendations on when to visit a doctor or healthcare professional. It contribute to several of the SDGs, such as SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being - by promoting early detection and treatment of health conditions during pregnancy, and SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals - by promoting collaborative partnerships with healthcare providers and organizations to improve maternal and child health outcomes.

* ***Community:*** A platform where expecting mothers can connect with each other, share their experiences and knowledge, and receive support throughout their pregnancy journey. Providing a community platform for pregnant women to connect, share information, and offer support can promote SDG 5 - Gender Equality - by creating a safe and inclusive space for women to exchange knowledge and experiences, and SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals - by fostering collaboration and partnership between women, healthcare providers, and other organizations to promote sustainable development.
