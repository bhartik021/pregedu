## Problem Statement

The infant mortality rate is still high in many developing countries due to a lack of access to prenatal care and education. Pregnant women do not receive adequate guidance on how to care for themselves and their growing fetus, leading to preventable complications and deaths. There is an opportunity to leverage digital tools to provide comprehensive and accessible guidance to expecting mothers, but there is still a lack of such guidance apps in many areas.

## Our Solution
