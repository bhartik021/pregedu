              During the fourth month of pregnancy, your baby's development
              continues at a rapid pace. By the end of this month, your baby
              will be about six inches long and weigh around four ounces. Their
              organs are beginning to function, and they can make facial
              expressions, including frowning and squinting. You may also be
              able to feel your baby moving around inside you, especially if
              this is not your first pregnancy.
