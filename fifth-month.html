              Congratulations! You've reached the halfway point of your
              pregnancy! The fifth month of pregnancy is a significant milestone
              for you and your baby. During this period, your baby is growing
              rapidly, and you might be experiencing several physical and
              emotional changes.

              The fifth month of pregnancy is from the 17th to the 20th week of
              pregnancy. At this stage, your baby is about the size of a banana
              and weighs around 10 ounces. The baby's bones are beginning to
              harden, and the skin is becoming less transparent. The baby can
              hear sounds outside of the womb and may even respond to them.
